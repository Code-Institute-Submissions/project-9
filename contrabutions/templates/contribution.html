        transport funds for getting to interviews and classes for those who want to gain employment but don't have the skills needed for most jobs out there today.
        Unfortunately we expect some would be unwelcoming to the idea of starting a new life with our support, in which case some of the general support funds will go 
        to providing food and blankets to those still living on the streets. We will also continue to find ways to support those who would need our help regardless of there 
        location.</p>
