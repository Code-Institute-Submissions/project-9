        <p class="storyText col-md-12">When I ran away from home I was only twenty years old, and scared for my life. I ran because my father was beating me daily, being careful not
        leave any marks that people could see. My Mum never even tried to stop him, she would say it was my fault or I deserved it. </p>
        <p class="storyText col-md-12">Living on the streets was hard, everyone would look at you and think you must be an addict or something because of how you lived. But all I
        wanted was somewhere safe to stay and a warm meal. I never wanted to be homeless but I beleived at the time that it would be better than being dead.</p>
        <p class="storyText col-md-12">When Help the Homeless found me I was close to giving up hope that my life would improve and was considering ending it. But now after being given a place to stay and training so that i could get a job, I have become
        a social sirveces officer to help support other women who suffer from domestic violance and being abbused. </p>

        <p class="storyText col-md-12">It is our aim is to provide retraining, so that all those we help can find employment. Each person on the help program
        will be required to take the manditory Maths and English courses, further thraining will be available once the manditory courses are complete. By retraining those 
        that we take in we hope that this would help them reintergrate into society and begin creating many opotunities in there future.</p>

        <p class="storyText col-md-12">The General support will be used to provide all the stuff needed to support the basic living needs such as food, clothing, medication
        transport funds for getting to interviews and classes for those who want to gain emplyment but dont have the skills needed for most jobs out there today.
        Unfortunatly we expect some would be unwelcoming to the idea of starting a new life with our support, in which case some of the general support funds will go 
        to providing food and blankets to those still living on the streets. We will also continue to find ways to support those who would need our help regardless of there 
        location.</p>
