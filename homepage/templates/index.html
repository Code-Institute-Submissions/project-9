        <p class="storyText col-md-12">When I ran away from home I was only twenty years old, and scared for my life. I ran because my father was beating me daily, being careful not
        leave any marks that people could see. My Mum never even tried to stop him, she would say it was my fault or I deserved it. </p>
        <p class="storyText col-md-12">When Help the Homeless found me I was close to giving up hope that my life would improve and was considering ending it. But now after being given a place to stay and training so that i could get a job, I have become
        a social sirveces officer to help support other women who suffer from domestic violance and being abbused. </p>

        <p class="storyText col-md-12">Before I became homeless I was a successful businessmen with my own family run DIY shop in our local town. But with the big corporations taking up all
        our customers we eventualy went bankrupt. with massive debt and no form of income everything was taken away from me, I had lost my wife and my home. With no one to turn to for help
        I ended up living on the streets begging for money so that i could at least feed myself now and then.</p>
        <p class="storyText col-md-12">Thanks to the support of Help the Homeless I am in the progress of putting my life back together, I have a roof over my head and am doing courses 
        in IT and accounting whilst working a part time job. If it was not for them i would still be sleeping rough trying to survive. </p>

        <p class="storyText col-md-12">The General support will be used to provide all the stuff needed to support the basic living needs such as food, clothing, medication
        transport funds for getting to interviews and classes for those who want to gain emplyment but dont have the skills needed for most jobs out there today.
        Unfortunatly we expect some would be unwelcoming to the idea of starting a new life with our support, in which case some of the general support funds will go 
        to providing food and blankets to those still living on the streets. We will also continue to find ways to support those who would need our help regardless of there 
        location.</p>
