project status: <strong>work in progress</strong>

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Danhayes3008/project-4.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Danhayes3008/project-4)

Due to a major error i couldnt fix on my first attempt to build this project, i have been left with no choise but to start it again.
Luckly at least half the work done can be salvaged and it is my hope that on this second attempt i will not run into the same problems
that i had in the last one.
