project status: <strong>work in progress</strong>

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Danhayes3008/project-4.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Danhayes3008/project-4)

Due to a major error i couldnt fix on my first attempt to build this project, i have been left with no choise but to start it again.
Luckly at least half the work done can be salvaged and it is my hope that on this second attempt i will not run into the same problems
that i had in the last one.

<strong><h2>Technologies:</h2></strong>

<strong><h3>HTML:</h3></strong>
As with all other websites html, there much that can be done using the html tags from making simple paragraphs to writing scripts, styles and even php coding. All that is needed is a imaginative mind toy find a way to use these features to make the site both look and run smoothly.

<strong><h3>CSS/SCSS:</h3></strong>
the css is used to make the site have a more profesional and interesting look to it but it dont stop there. CSS files can be generated using SCSS coding which is more neater and structured than making a single css style file. With the SCSS you can have all the styles seperated into multiple files so that when you need to go back and change something all you have to do is search that one file of lets say 20 lines of code instead of searching over 100 lines of code. This then can be intergrated into a main file wy simply importing the scss files into another scss file to generate the css file that will hold all the styling for the site. In my opinion this is the best method to control the styling and helps prevent long hours of searching for that one line that needs tweeking.

<strong><h3>JS:</h3></strong>
the use of Java Script is to give the site functionality.

<strong><h3>Django:</h3></strong>
Django makes up the backbone of this project. with its well organised structure sites can be quickly built and deployed. It is one of many python extensions by
by far it is the best one in my current opionion for web site development.

<strong><h3>project restructuring:<h3></strong>

Whilst trying to fix my donation history section of the profile page i was made to overhaul alot of the coding to make it all work. This was due to naming conflicts, after a few hours of working on it with a fellow student who helped me i was able to get the site working how i wanted it. The credit for this all goes to Chris Zielinski (ckz7880 on slack channels) from code institue slack chatrooms as he walked me though fixing my site step by step after i made a right mess of it. Luckly not much was needed to be fixed but a rewrite of the carts context file, some models, the forms dealing with the donation and the views that was needed to fix all this. After fixing the problems with my code i was better able to understand how we were able to filter the donations made by the user logged in. I also received help from Faidon Minas Dermesonoglou from code institue slack chatrooms. Faidon (Feddie_lead on slack channels) tried to expain the problem to me but because my code was a mess i was not able to correctly implement his advice on how to filter donations by user logged in.

I managed to get some of the donation history section of the profile page working by following the code another student posted on the slack channels. If it wasnt for slack user r_andy79 i wouldnt have gotten this working so soon. This method that i was using was only working in a limited capasity but after my coding was fixed with the help of Chris Zielinski i was able to get it working correctly.

Anna_ci on slack channels helped me get my site working on heroku. With her help i was able to get heroku to work in the terminal on visual studio code were i am doing my project.

After struggling for days trying to get my background image sorted i came accross a video on youtube that helped me get it working. The video i followed to get this to work was
